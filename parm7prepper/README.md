# Parm7Prepper 

Parm7Prepper is a simple tool for preparing parm7 input files generated by glycam.com's Carbohydrate builder utility for Molecular Dynamics simulations in NAMD. This is accomplished through reordering Parm7 inputs provided by GLYCAM into the order they are expected in by NAMD, avoiding the 'Amber end of file error'.

## Files Included
```
	src\
		Parm7Prepper.java
		Parm7File.java
	bin\
		Parm7Prepper.class
		Parm7File.class
	Makefile
	README.md
```

## Compilation

Complie Parm7Prepper by typing the unix 'make' command in the same directory as this file. Executables are compilled into the bin directory. 

## Usage

Invoke Parm7Prepper by running the following command in the same directory as the file to be reordered;

```
java -cp /path/to/Parm7Prepper/bin Parm7Prepper input.parm7
```

where "input.parm7" is the .parm7 file for a **solvated** structure generated by glycam.com's Carbohydrate builder utility. 

Output is a file called "reordered.parm7" created in the same directory as the invoked command corresponding to a reordered version of the input.parm7 file which can be accepted by NAMD.
