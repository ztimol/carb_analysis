#---- How to set up MD simulations in NAMD using glycam ----#
# By Ryan Lazar (LZRRYA001) November 2019
#---------
1. Build the molecule 

Go to glycam.org, click on the Carbohydrate builder tool.
Build the structure. Click done.
Under options click Solvate Structures.
	Select yes and set the solvent box shape to cubic. Reduce the minimum distance between center of solute atom and solvent atom to 0.5 to better match VMD's solvate plugin.
Glycam Web will minimize and solvate the structure. 
Select download all structures.

2. Fix the files

As part of the download you will have 1.parm7, 1.rst7, 1.pdb and 1_noWAT.parm7, 1_noWAT.rst7 and 1_noWAT.pdb. We will only use these. 
Rename the files using some convention. I use toppar and coor prefix for the .parm7 and rst7 files respectively. Followed by molecule name and MIN suffix. I also append solvated structures with H2O. 
	e.g.	1.parm7 => toppar_aLRha1-2aLRha_GLY_MIN_H2O.parm7
			1.rst7 => coor_aLRha1-2aLRha_GLY_MIN_H2O.rst7
			1.pdb => aLRha1-2aLRha_GLY_MIN_H2O.pdb

			1_noWAT.parm7 => toppar_aLRha1-2aLRha_GLY_MIN.parm7
			1_noWAT.rst7 => coor_aLRha1-2aLRha_GLY_MIN.rst7
			1_noWAT.pdb => aLRha1-2aLRha_GLY_MIN_H2O.pdb

Fix ordering of solvated parm7 file (e.g. toppar_aLRha1-2aLRha_GLY_MIN_H2O.parm7) using Parm7Prepper (download at https://bitbucket.org/LZRRYA001/parm7prepper/src/master/, see instructions on how to run there). 

Once Parm7Prepper has produced reordered.parm7 file delete old parm7 and rename.

3. Configure simulation

See runEQ.conf and run1.conf (restart file). 

Change file names to match input files generated in step two. 
Fix PBC basis vectors and cell origin.
	In VMD, load the .parm7 file of the solvated structure. Then load the corresponding rst7 file. 
	In tk concole
		measure minmax $everyone 
		measure center $everyone
	Calculate basis vector lengths and extract cell origin, round to two decimals. 

	Change the cellBasiscVectors and cellOrigin for PBC in .conf file accordingly 
	Fix PMEGridSize
